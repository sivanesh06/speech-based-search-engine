### üß† **Purpose**

This script is a **voice-activated web search assistant**. It listens to your voice input, converts it into text, and performs a **Google search** based on the recognized command.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

1. **Speech Engine Initialization**

   * Uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech to interact with the user.
   * `speech_recognition` library is used to recognize spoken input from the microphone.

2. **Key Functions**

   * `speak(text)`: Speaks the given text using TTS.
   * `take_command()`:

     * Prompts user for input.
     * Listens using microphone.
     * Converts speech to text using Google‚Äôs speech recognition API.
   * `search_web(query)`:

     * Constructs a Google search URL using the spoken query.
     * Opens the results in a web browser.
     * Speaks out the action.

3. **Main Logic**

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       query = take_command()
       search_web(query)
   ```

   * Runs the speech recognition.
   * If successful, opens a web search for the spoken query.

---

### üó£Ô∏è **Example Flow**

* User runs the script.
* System says: ‚ÄúWhat do you want to search for?‚Äù
* User says: ‚ÄúBest Italian restaurants nearby‚Äù
* The browser opens a Google search for that query.
